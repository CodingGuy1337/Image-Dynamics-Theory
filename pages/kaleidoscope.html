  <div class="h1">Your mind is a kaleidoscope with rules.</div>
  <p class="sub">
    A kaleidoscope takes a messy scene, folds it through mirrors, and produces a pattern. Your brain does something similar:
    it takes messy sensory input, folds it through memories, beliefs, and goals, and produces “what the world feels like right now.”

  <h2>The simple picture</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine your mind holds a shifting picture called <b>Z</b>. IDT says the picture changes because your mind is constantly trying to make a few things true at once:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Match what you're seeing</b> (sensory fit).</li>
    <li><b>Predict what happens next</b> (reduce surprise).</li>
    <li><b>Keep intentions coherent</b> (act like one agent).</li>
    <li><b>Keep relationships consistent</b> (cause, social meaning, object permanence).</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="callout">
    When constraints fight, the pattern “snaps” into a new arrangement. That snap is what a mental shift feels like.
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Slices: what you notice</h2>
  <p>
    A <b>slice</b> is the part of the picture that dominates awareness. When you're hungry, the slice favors food. When you're embarrassed, it favors social signals.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Orientation</b>: which way the mind is pointed (problem-solving, social defense, curiosity).</li>
    <li><b>Radius</b>: how intense the slice is (how much bandwidth it steals).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Liminality: the “rearrange me” slider</h2>
  <p>
    Liminality is how willing the kaleidoscope is to rotate. Low liminality: the pattern locks and you stay stubborn. High liminality: mirrors spin and new meanings appear, but you may lose stability.
  </p>
  <p class="sub">“Going with the flow” is usually medium liminality: enough flexibility to adapt, not enough to dissolve.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Reflection: not poetry, just bookkeeping</h2>
  <p>
    A good reflection mentions: the situation, the action, what was expected, what happened, and what that implies for next time. In the model, it's a decoded summary of a trajectory.
