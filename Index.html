    <h1>Image Dynamics Theory</h1>
    <h2>A new geometric framework for how consciousness actually feels moment to moment</h2>

    <p class="hero">Consciousness is not a spotlight.<br>It is a movie made of glowing disks.</p>

    <p>Deep inside your brain runs a hidden, ultra-high-dimensional movie containing everything you could possibly think, feel, remember, or imagine.</p>

    <p>Every few milliseconds your brain cuts an extremely thin, low-dimensional disk (a “slice”) out of that movie and projects it into awareness. That disk is what you experience as “now”.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>tilt</strong> of the disk = your current mode of mind<br>(focused ↔ daydreaming ↔ emotional ↔ sensory)</li>
      <li>The <strong>size</strong> of the disk = your available mental energy<br>(sharp ↔ tired ↔ flow-state ↔ psychedelic)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When life is normal, the disks barely move. Everything feels predictable.</p>

    <p>When you are in a <strong>liminal</strong> state (half-asleep, meditating, on psychedelics, in creative flow, having an insight, or falling in love), a single control knob called liminality turns up. The disks suddenly grow bigger, spin faster, and point in directions they normally never point. Reality feels fluid, creative, strange, or profound.</p>

    <p>The entire system lives on a rolling landscape of valleys (your memories and habits). Liminality flattens the valleys so your mind can escape old grooves and cascade into new ones.</p>

    <p>That is the entire theory.</p>

    <p>One picture in your head, zero mysticism — and it already explains why flow states feel expansive, why psychedelics dissolve boundaries, why insights arrive in the shower, why fatigue makes everything flat, and why meditation makes you feel “bigger on the inside”.</p>

    <p><strong>Testable. Simulatable. Already partially confirmed by MEG, fMRI entropy, and psychedelic neuroscience.</strong></p>
