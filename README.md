## Overview
Image Dynamics Theory proposes that cognition can be modeled as the relaxation of a structured internal state within a high-dimensional latent space under competing constraints. Rather than treating intelligence as a feedforward or token-generating process, this framework describes thinking as an iterative dynamical process that minimizes internal incoherence across perception, prediction, action, and relational structure.

The theory is metaphysical in origin but formally expressed, with the intent that it can be implemented, simulated, and empirically tested.

## Core Concepts
- Latent cognitive state represented as a structured vector field
- Energy-based formulation governing internal consistency
- Iterative relaxation dynamics ("microslices") as cognition
- Semantic meaning as direction in latent space
- Action commitment as magnitude (radius) of projected state
- Emotion and affect as control parameters (e.g. liminality, noise, gain)
- Language and reflection as readouts of stabilized internal states
