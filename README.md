Every few milliseconds the brain projects a thin, low-dimensional **disk** (“slice”) from a hidden high-dimensional movie.  
That disk is your felt “now”.

- Tilt of the disk → cognitive mode  
- Size of the disk → mental energy / resources  
- Liminality (L) → single control knob that flattens memory valleys, expands reachable space, and drives creative/psychedelic states

Testable, simulatable, and already matches MEG/fMRI entropy, microstate transitions, and psychedelic data.

### One-sentence summary
“Conscious experience is the moment-to-moment low-dimensional projection of a high-dimensional neural trajectory moving on a liminality-controlled attractor landscape.”
